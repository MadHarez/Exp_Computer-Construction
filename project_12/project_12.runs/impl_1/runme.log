WARNING: [DRC PDRC-153] Gated clock check: Net PC_init/Inst_code_reg[31]_1 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin PC_init/C32_reg_i_2/O, cell PC_init/C32_reg_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
